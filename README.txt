================= IMPORTANT =====================
Please BACKUP your store AND database before 
attempting any of these changes.
I will not be held responsible!
=================================================

WHAT DOES THIS MODULE DO?
This modification adds a Ship Order Date feature to the checkout process. The end-user is presented with an aesthetic,
fully configurable pop-up calendar for them to select their delivery date.  Changes are also seen in the admin 
side (Invoice, Packing Slip, View Order) and are reflected in emails to the customer that are generated when 
completing an order, and when updating order status via Admin.

========================================================

INSTALL (For upgrades see below):

a. BACKUP ALL OF YOUR FILES that you will be overwriting as well as your Database before installing!!!

b. Run the sql statement (deliverydate.sql) against your database using 
Admin->Tools->Install SQL patches.

c. Copy files to your install.  
   - Be sure to use the directory appropriate for your Zen Cart version (1.3.8, 1.3.9, 1.5.1, 1.5.5, 1.5.6, 1.5.7 etc.).
   - Make sure to change any folders labeled YOUR_TEMPLATE or YOUR_TEMPLATE_RESPONSIVE to the template you are using.

To change blocked out dates, open the following file and read the instructions contained within it: includes/modules/pages/checkout_shipping/jscript_calendar_head.php


d. The sql file adds a new setting under configuration>minimum values. If set to a value greater than 0, delivery date is required. If set to 0 or empty, delivery date is not required. Default is 1 - required.

e. There is now an option beginning in Zen Cart 1.5.5 to not display the Order Delivery Date selector based on the
   deliver to address.
   the ZC 1.5.5+ file: includes\extra_datafiles\order_delivery_date_location.php contains a define that indicates on
   which destination address type the delivery date field should be shown (national to the store's location,
   international, or both). (When not shown it ignores the settings above about required or optional, but when shown
   then it follows the settings of required or optional.)

UPGRADE: 
If you are upgrading from an older version than 2.4, please run the file 
update_to_2.4.sql in Admin->Tools->Install SQL Patches. 
If you are upgrading from an older version than 2.7 (including those from before 2.4), please run the file 
update_to_2.7.sql in Admin->Tools->Install SQL Patches. 

If you are upgrading from a version before 2.5.2, there are core files that no longer require revision to support this
plugin and therefore either now or on your next upgrade the changes previously made to the following files are no longer
required and can be removed.  This does not necessarily mean that the file should be "blindly" replaced with an original
version of the file, but that there should be a review performed to see what changes may have been incorporated by other
plugins.

HISTORY:

02/15/2021 by mc12345678 (https://mc12345678.com) (v2.7.1) There have been a lot of changes in the core Zen Cart Software.
  To accomodate, there are ways that this software can be introduced without significant modification of the core software.
  The biggest changes to that software are in the admin main programs where the order_delivery_date field is to be presented.
  Changes made:
  - Moved language definitions out of individual language files and to a combined extra_definitions file.
  - Incorporated use of sprintf to support positioning text in support of multiple languages.
  - Added Zen Cart 1.5.6 specific fileset .
  - Added Zen Cart 1.5.7 fileset.
  - Improved checking to apply jQuery.noConflict to cases where jQuery has been loaded For Zen Cart 1.5.5+.
  - Updated order_delivery_date to be datetime and possibly set to NULL though with a default of '0001-01-01 00:00:00'

08/11/2018 by mc12345678 (http://mc12345678.com) (v2.6.1) as identified by a few people, the new checkout plugin that offers
  a single page check (One Page Checkout) was found not to be compatible with this plugin.  This version incorporates use
  of notifiers in that software and the way it has reworked core Zen Cart operation to maintain operation.  Also more 
  work has been done to move operations further away from the core code and to make use of common characteristics in the
  Zen Cart software.
  - Modified the template files to expand the ability to offer modified content.
  - Modified usage of global variables to reference $GLOBALS[''] instead of using the global construct.
  - Updated the jscript_a-mootools.js file to version 1.2.5.  

01/28/2018 by mc12345678 (http://mc12345678.com) (v2.6) as requested by Audrey at: https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?92762-Order-Delivery-Date-Support-Thread&p=1341081#post1341081
  incorporated a method to display/hide (and therefore support requiring) the order delivery date field based on whether
  the reciepient address is within the store's nation or outside of it. Setting for this is current in the file:
  includes\extra_datafiles\order_delivery_date_location.php
  - Also updated the confirmation_checkout pages again to potentially support
  expected functionality of using PayPal's In Context payment if it has been incorporated into the store.
  - Corrected minor items that would issue notices if site were run in strict mode.

11/13/2017 by mc12345678 (http://mc12345678.com) updated to finally fully work with ZC 1.5.5 with minimal software edits
  and using the ZC observer/notifier system where able.

02/15/2017 by mc12345678 http://mc12345678.com
